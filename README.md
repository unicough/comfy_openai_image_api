# OpenAI Image API

This custom node uses OpenAI Image API to generate image (if no input image is provided) or edit image (if input image is provided) with the latest gpt-image-1 model. To use it, you will need to provide your OpenAI API key. This makes the node to be friendly for situations where ComfyUI serves as API server, because you don't have to login like the official OpenAI GPT Image 1 node does.

- Prompt only with no input image:

- One image input:
![One image](images/one_image.png)

- Multiple images input:
![Multiple images](images/multiple_images.png)

> [!NOTE]
> This projected was created with a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/cookiecutter-comfy-extension) template. It helps you start writing custom nodes without worrying about the Python setup.

## Quickstart

1. Install [ComfyUI](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started).
1. Install [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager)
1. Look up this extension in ComfyUI-Manager. If you are installing manually, clone this repository under `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`.
1. Restart ComfyUI.

# Features

- A list of features

## Develop

To install the dev dependencies and pre-commit (will run the ruff hook), do:

```bash
cd openai_image_api
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```

The `-e` flag above will result in a "live" install, in the sense that any changes you make to your node extension will automatically be picked up the next time you run ComfyUI.

## Publish to Github

Install Github Desktop or follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for ssh.

1. Create a Github repository that matches the directory name. 
2. Push the files to Git
```
git add .
git commit -m "project scaffolding"
git push
``` 

## Writing custom nodes

An example custom node is located in [node.py](src/openai_image_api/nodes.py). To learn more, read the [docs](https://docs.comfy.org/essentials/custom_node_overview).


## Tests

This repo contains unit tests written in Pytest in the `tests/` directory. It is recommended to unit test your custom node.

- [build-pipeline.yml](.github/workflows/build-pipeline.yml) will run pytest and linter on any open PRs
- [validate.yml](.github/workflows/validate.yml) will run [node-diff](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/node-diff) to check for breaking changes

## Publishing to Registry

If you wish to share this custom node with others in the community, you can publish it to the registry. We've already auto-populated some fields in `pyproject.toml` under `tool.comfy`, but please double-check that they are correct.

You need to make an account on https://registry.comfy.org and create an API key token.

- [ ] Go to the [registry](https://registry.comfy.org). Login and create a publisher id (everything after the `@` sign on your registry profile). 
- [ ] Add the publisher id into the pyproject.toml file.
- [ ] Create an api key on the Registry for publishing from Github. [Instructions](https://docs.comfy.org/registry/publishing#create-an-api-key-for-publishing).
- [ ] Add it to your Github Repository Secrets as `REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

A Github action will run on every git push. You can also run the Github action manually. Full instructions [here](https://docs.comfy.org/registry/publishing). Join our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/comfyorg) if you have any questions!


### Using AI Badgr (OpenAI-Compatible Backend)

If you're already using the OpenAI API, you can also point your client at **AI Badgr**, which implements the same API surface (chat completions, streaming, JSON mode).

AI Badgr uses optimized open-source models to provide more affordable inference and also supports optional private/self-hosted modes for teams that need additional data control.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aibadgr.com/api/v1
```

**Python:**
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", base_url="https://aibadgr.com/api/v1")
response = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}], max_tokens=200)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```


**cURL:**
```bash
curl https://aibadgr.com/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}],"max_tokens":200}'
```

**Notes:**
- Streaming: `"stream": true`
- JSON mode: `"response_format": {"type": "json_object"}`
- Because AI Badgr follows the OpenAI API spec, most existing OpenAI client code works by only changing the `base_url`.
